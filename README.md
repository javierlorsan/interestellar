A journey through the universe 

Interstellar is a journey through the universe observing stars, planets, constellations, nebulae, singularities such as black holes and other celestial objects never seen before that are billions light years from earth. Some of them can be stereoscopic and others can give a three-dimensional feeling. Sometimes the journey can be slower due to the strong gravitational pull of some of them. Sometimes we will pass very close and you have to be very careful because they can explode. Go now into deep space.

Black holes are originating from the cold remains of ancient stars, they are so dense that no material particle, not even light, is capable of escaping their powerful gravitational force.

What color are black holes?

According to experts, black holes are invisible to the human eye because they do not emit light. but when matter falls over its event horizon, it heats up and produces radiation that can be observed through the electromagnetic spectrum and this is how I imagine them.

This generative artwork attempts to represent, visually, what these singularities would be like, with gravitational force, rotational movement, transformation, cosmic rays and gas. It is developed using singularities of Math Functions.

I have always been fascinated by these singularities, especially, because inside them the same physical laws do not apply as in the rest of the universe. As in generative art, the same rules of traditional computing do not apply either.

Just press “s” key or mouse click and enjoy the journey watching stars, planets, constellations, nebulae, black holes rotating and changing shape and other celestial objects never seen. You can pause the journey when ever you want pressing “space bar” or mouse click and press “s” or mouse click again to continue (Sometimes the journey can take a few seconds to start).
