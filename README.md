A journey through the universe 

Interstellar is a journey through the universe observing stars, planets forming and singularities such as black holes, originating from the cold remains of ancient stars, they are so dense that no material particle, not even light, is capable of escaping their powerful gravitational force.

This artwork attempts to represent, visually, what these singularities would be like, with their gravitational force, rotational movement, and transformation. It is developed using singularities of Math Functions. 

I have always been fascinated by these singularities, especially, because inside them the same physical laws do not apply as in the rest of the universe. As in generative art, the same rules of traditional computing do not apply either.

Just press "s" key and enjoy the journey watching stars, planets forming and black holes rotating and changing shape. You can pause the journey when ever you want pressing "space bar"
